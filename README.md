# Basic Calculator
# By Shardul Shah
Basic Calculator with I/O
Features such as bracket usage, exponents, negative numbers, and decimals will be added later on. 
Calculator uses infix notation (e.g. 40*30-50).
Python modules regex or shlex are not used in this. The purpose is to practice manual string/character handling, and transferring data in lists, tuples, and dictonaries, manually.
In the future, I will use regex/shlex modules to simplify the parsing and handling of input strings, and add the features listed above.

Source of the termcolor module and code: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor. I do not own termcolor.py in any way.

# Run "python3 calc1.py" if the module termcolor exists on your machine. 
Full termcolor module along with set up instructions, from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor, is included in this directory.
# Else, run "python3 calc_basic.py"
