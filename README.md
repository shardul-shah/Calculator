# Calculator
# By Shardul Shah
Basic Calculator with I/O
Features such as bracket usage, exponents, negative numbers, or decimals will be added later on. 
Calculator uses infix notation (e.g. 40*30-50).

Source of the termcolor module and code: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor. I do not own termcolor.py.
